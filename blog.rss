                <description>In Komodo&#x27;s bottom pane there is a widget call *Version Control*.  This tool is context driven and tries to include the most commonly used version control features into one easily accessed tool [...]</description>

                <description>As you may know by now (or maybe you don&#x27;t, which is ok since I&#x27;m going to follow up by stating the fact anyway...), Komodo has been in development for over 15 years now [...]</description>

                <description>I had thoughts about trying something crazy with Komodo...so when ActiveState held its annual hackathon I saw it as a great opportunity for me to try out one of these ideas. Before I jump into what I did [...]</description>

                <description>Nowadays, it seems that IDEs and text editors are to software developers as sports cars are to car enthusiasts. Ask any developer what tool they use to write their code and why, and you will get a million different answers [...]</description>

                <description>As an IDE, one of the features that Komodo must have and must do well (IMO) is code intelligence. It MUST help you understand the code your working on more quickly (even if...ESPECIALLY IF it&#x27;s yours) [...]</description>

                <description>Something that has always been part of the Komodo design philosophy has been integration. Though Komodo should provide tooling to make our users more productive, it should NOT try to do EVERYTHING.  Integration, not imitation, is the key [...]</description>

                <description>If you&#x27;ve never run Komodo before or if this is the first time you&#x27;re running a major version (eg. you were using Komodo 9.3 and have just upgraded to Komodo X), then Komodo will show you the First Start Wizard as it loads [...]</description>

                <description>It is easy to take for granted Komodo IDE&#x27;s superb debugging support. Komodo excels at debugging common scripting languages like Perl, Python, Tcl, and Ruby. It can also debug PHP, Node.js, and XSLT. With Komodo X [...]</description>

                <description>If you installed Komodo X recently and you were not one of the users who participated in the Beta release phase then when you opened Komodo you might have thought you downloaded the wrong program (Chess any one?).  But you didn&#x27;t [...]</description>

                <description>Komodo has always been a very fast IDE. So much so that combined with its minimalistic UI many users tend to confuse Komodo IDE with an editor. Of course Komodo is an editor too, but to call it just an editor would be doing it a disservice [...]</description>
