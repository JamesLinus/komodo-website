                <description>It is easy to take for granted Komodo IDE&#x27;s superb debugging support. Komodo excels at debugging common scripting languages like Perl, Python, Tcl, and Ruby. It can also debug PHP, Node.js, and XSLT. With Komodo X [...]</description>

                <description>If you installed Komodo X recently and you were not one of the users who participated in the Beta release phase then when you opened Komodo you might have thought you downloaded the wrong program (Chess any one?).  But you didn&#x27;t [...]</description>

                <description>The word *editor* and IDE (integrated development environments) are often mistakenly used interchangeably. However, there are some big differences between the two. The extra functionality you get with an IDE can provide significant time savings [...]</description>
