<div class="features">
    <h2 class="centered">
        Being a multi-language IDE, Komodo also supports all major languages<br/>
        including Python, PHP, NodeJS, Ruby, Go, Perl, Tcl, and more
    </h2>
        
    <div class="left">
        <h2>Advanced Editor / Intelligent Code Editor</h2>
        <p>
            Komodo IDE helps Perl devs write code faster and more accurately, with
            multi-language syntax checking and highlighting, auto-complete, calltips,
            snippets, macros and other productivity-enhancing features. With code
            refactoring (renaming variables and class members, extracting methods), you can
            make global code changes, saving time compared to making changes manually. Also
            includes code folding, split view, multi-window editing, smart syntax checking
            and highlighting, snippets and macros, and more.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Graphical Debugging</h2>
        <p>
            Enjoy debugging with Perl 5.*. Run it locally in the IDE or
            remotely on an external server or platform. Configure breakpoints, create
            and debug regular expressions with the RX Toolkit.
        </p>
            
        <h2>Unit Testing for Perl</h2>
        <p>
            Create and run unit tests with PerlUnit, and detect performance issues with
            function-by-function code profiling (also reads Callgrind/Cachegrind
            format).
        </p>
        
        <h2>Perl IDE for Teams</h2>
        <p>
            Code Collaboration allows you and your team to edit a document with multiple
            users simultaneously. The Komodo Shared Toolbox allows you to store common
            snippets, macros, and more via network share, source code control, or the
            Publish feature. Coding Standards lets you keep shared work consistent with
            version control and auto-formatting, while Komodo’s extended functionality
            allows you to scale your projects as required with extensions for integrated
            technologies.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
        <h2>Code Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
            Code efficiently with auto-complete and calltips for Perl in Komodo IDE. Code
            refactoring features smart code-transformation capabilities including Rename
            Variable, Rename Class Member, and Method Extraction. Structure code easily
            with Code Browser. Komodo supports any framework (ie. Cake Perl, jQuery) and
            PerlDoc.
        </p>
            
        <h2>Version Control & Integrated Tools</h2>
        <p>
            Version control, interactive shells, code profiling, integrated user
            testing, toolbox and publishing support. Subversion, Mercurial, Git,
            Perforce, Bazaar, CVS are also supported. Build, edit, and debug regular
            expressions with the Regex Toolkit. 
        </p>
            
        <h2>Database Integration</h2>
        <p>
            The Database Explorer supports SQLite with extensions for MySQL and
            Oracle.  These tools allow you to have a visual representation of
            your databases scheme that you're working with.
        </p>
            
        <h2>Extend & Customize</h2>
        <p>
            Vi/Vim, emacs and other included key bindings provide you with a familiar
            editing experience, straight out of the box. Customize your UI and editor
            pane with a variety of themes, and extend your editing and IDE functionality
            with a multitude of available add-ons. Extend color schemes, syntax
            checkers, and more.
