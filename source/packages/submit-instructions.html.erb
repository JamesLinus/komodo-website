            We use GitHub for all our packages (previously called resources), follow the steps below to share your package via GitHub. Why do we use GitHub? Because we love GitHub and we want contributors to be fully in control of their own contributions.

        <p>
            If you aren't familiar with git or GitHub <a href="https://guides.github.com/">we recommend reading up on it</a>.

        <h1>How to Contribute a Package</h1>
        
        <ol class="decimal">
            <li>
                Create a <a href="https://github.com/new">new GitHub Public Repository</a> (<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/">Help?</a>).
            </li>
            <li>
                Select <strong>Initialize this repository with a README</strong>.

            <li>
                Click the Releases tab and press <strong>Create a new release</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill out the form and drag your package onto the <strong>Attach binaries</strong> section (ie. your addon `.xpi`, your color scheme `.ksf`, your macro `.komodotool`, etc).
            </li>
            <li>
                Once saved, <a href="https://github.com/Komodo/Packages">head over to our Packages repository</a> and click on the file which best describes your package (eg. addons.yml).
            </li>
            <li>
                Hit the pencil icon at the top right of the file, right next to <strong>Raw, Blame and History</strong>. Add your repository to the file using the format of: `My Addon Name: http://my-github-repo-url`, then hit <strong>Commit Changes</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                On the next screen hit the <strong>Create pull request</strong> button.

            Now that you have a github repository you can <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/getting-your-project-on-github/">push your code to your repository</a> and allow others to contribute to it. Your repository description and readme will show up on our Packages section.

        <h1>Blogs</h1>
        <p>
            We accept blogs from anyone willing to submit content that is in some
            way Komodo related. Your blog does not need to have Komodo as its main
            topic, for example you can submit blogs for:
        </p>
        <ul class="disc">
            <li>
                How you created your website using technology X
            </li>
            <li>
                What tools you're using to automate your workflow
            </li>
            <li>
                What macro's / snippets / etc. you've developed to help you with your work
            </li>
            <li>
                Etc.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
            Submitting a Blog
        </h2>
        <p>
            Blogs can be written entirely in markdown, so you don't need to run
            a copy of the Komodo Website just to test your blog - use any markdown
            editor you prefer.
        </p>
        <p>
            To submit your blog you need to:
        </p>
        <ol class="decimal">
            <li>
                Fork the
                <a href="https://github.com/Komodo/komodo-website">Komodo-Website repository</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Create your blog under the
                <a href="https://github.com/Komodo/komodo-website/tree/master/src/pages/blog">
                    relevant date folder

                <em>if the right date folder does not exist create it.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
                Create your blog file using the format <code>title-of-my-blog.hmtl.md</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the following template for the start of your blog:
                <pre>
                    <code>---
title: Title of My Blog

                Write your blog underneath using Markdown or HTML
            </li>
            <li>

    <div id="pane-screencasts" class="hide">
        <h1>Screencasts</h1>
        <p>
            We currently do not have a workflow set up yet to contribute screencasts.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you would like to submit a screencast please email us at
            <a href="mailto:komodo@activestate.com?subject=Screencast%20Submission">komodo@activestate.com</a> with a link to your video.

    <div id="pane-code" class="hide">
        <h1>Code</h1>
        <p>
            To contribute actual code to Komodo Edit (and indirectly Komodo IDE)
            you can fork the
            <a href="https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit">Komodo Edit repository on github</a>.
            From there your first step will be to
            <a href="https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit/blob/master/README.md#building-komodo">
                get your own Komodo build going</a>
            so you can test your changes.
            <br>
            Once you have your build going there are two ways you can contribute
            to Komodo development:
        </p>

        <h2>Solving Bugs</h2>
        <p>
            Want to get your hands dirty? You can
            <a href="https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit/issues/" target="_blank">
                search for open bugs on our Bug Tracker
            </a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            To be able to fix a bug you'll need to get your own build of Komodo Edit
            running; you can
            <a href="https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit">
                obtain the source and instructions from our GitHub repository
            </a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            To avoid working on a bug that is already being worked on by someone else,
            please express your intent in the bug report before starting.
        </p>

        <h2>Implementing Features</h2>
        <p>
            Just like with bugs, you can
            <a href="https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit/labels/Enhancement" target="_blank">
                search our Bug Tracker
            </a>
            for open Enhancement requests.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have your own idea for a feature that you would like to implement
            that you think should be part of the core Komodo experience, please
            <a href="https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit/issues/new">
            file an enhancement request</a> for it and express your intent to implement it.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="pane-bugs" class="hide">
        <h1>Bug Reports</h1>
        <p>
            The most obvious way to help any software project is to
            <a href="https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit/issues/new" target="_blank">report bugs</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you really want to help out with this we'd encourage you to try our
            <a href="http://downloads.activestate.com/Komodo/nightly/">

    <div id="pane-documentation" class="hide">
        <h1>Documentation</h1>
        <p>
            Writing documentation is a big part of any software project. We recognize
            this and have recently launched our new <a href="http://docs.komodoide.com">
            documentation website</a>. Which we will continue to build and emphasize.
        </p>

        <p>
            To contribute to our documentation you can fork the
            <a href="https://github.com/Komodo/komodo-documentation">
                komodo-documentation repository
            </a>
            and start submitting
            <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request">pull requests</a>
            .
        </p>

    <div id="pane-other" class="hide">
        <h1>Other</h1>
        <p>
            If you wish to contribute in some other way please
            <a href="http://forum.komodoide.com/">post about it on our forums</a>.
            We will let you know what the best procedure is for getting your
            contributions used in our projects.
