        <h2>Advanced Editor / Intelligent Code Editor</h2>
        <p>
           Komodo IDE helps Python devs write code faster and more accurately,
           with multi-language syntax checking and highlighting, auto-complete,
           calltips, snippets, macros and other productivity-enhancing features.
           With code refactoring (renaming variables and class members,
           extracting methods), you can make global code changes, saving time
           compared to making changes manually. Also includes code folding,
           split view, multi-window editing, smart syntax checking and
           highlighting, snippets and macros, and more.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Graphical Debugging</h2>
        <p>
            Enjoy debugging and code profiling for Python 2.4 and higher. Launch
            applications locally in the IDE, remotely debug applications
            running on a remote server, or Python subprocessse connect to Komodo
            for debugging.  Configure breakpoints, step in, interact
            and inspect runtime using an Interactive Python shell, and create
            and debug regular expressions with the RX Toolkit.
        </p>
            
        <h2>Unit Testing for Python</h2>
        <p>
           Unit testing supports the Python unittest framework, with extensible

        <p>
            Code Collaboration allows you and your team to edit a document with multiple
            users simultaneously. The Komodo Shared Toolbox allows you to store common
            snippets, macros, and more via network share, source code control, or the
            Publish feature. Coding Standards lets you keep shared work consistent with
            version control and auto-formatting, while Komodo’s extended functionality
            allows you to scale your projects as required with extensions for integrated
            technologies.

        <h2>Code Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
            Code efficiently with auto-complete and calltips for Python in Komodo
            IDE. Code refactoring features smart code-transformation capabilities
            including Rename Variable, Rename Class Member, and Method Extraction.
            Structure code easily with Code Browser. Komodo supports any framework
            (eg. Django, Flask).
        </p>
            
        <h2>Version Control & Integrated Tools</h2>
        <p>

        <p>
            One-click code profiling allows you to
            analyze your code performance on a function-by-function basis,
            allowing you to quickly detect hotspots. The code profiler tracks
            which function calls are made, how many times those functions get
            called and how long the calls take to complete. Komodo code profiling
            also supports the regular Python cProfile pstats format.
        </p>
