        Like pastebin, now you can easily share snippets of code with other people directly from Komodo. Simply make a text selection and use the editor: right-click context menu and choose Share Code via <a href="http://kopy.io">Kopy.io</a>. <a href="http://kopy.io">Kopy.io</a> supports client side encryption, so you can make those shared pastes more secure.

      name: Color Schemes and Themes
      description: We've updated the Komodo color schemes and we've made <em>Tomorrow_Dark</em> the new default Komodo color scheme (a dark-based scheme). The Komodo UI has been updated to match the latest operating systems, so Komodo now looks even better. We also added the ability to tweak the editor line height spacing.
