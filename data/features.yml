          name: CSS Auto-Completions
          description: CSS, LESS, and SCSS files now support auto-completions and code browsing. This will also work when editing HTML and using CSS classes or ID's in your markup. With the 9.3.0 release this only works for CSS files living at the same or a lower level as the HTML file, we will very soon be supporting this project wide.

            * **In-line Syntax Checking:** When syntax errors/warnings occur a small notification popup will show at the bottom right corner of your editor window.
            * **Package Manager 2.0:** You can now fully manage your packages via Komodo, ie. uninstall, update, etc. (the previous version only allowed you to install). Advanced functionality currently only works for addons, skins, and languages.
            * **Enhanced Multi-Caret Mode:** Multiple caret mode is now much more flexible and useful, allowing for more complex actions than before. You can also now set multi-carets with ctrl+click.
            * **Embedded Find/Replace:** Find and replace has been significantly overhauled and is now part of the editor (rather than a popup dialog).
            * **Multiple Find Result Tabs:** Every search now opens in its own result tab, you are no longer limited to 2 tabs. Find results now also show a new input field that allow you to search again with the same input but a different search pattern.
            * **Macros renamed to Userscripts:** Toolbox Macros have been renamed to Userscripts. Macros also still exist but only through the toolbar or menu interface. When you save them to your toolbox they effectively become userscripts.
            * **Quick Start on Tabs:** When opening a new tab you now get a view that lets you pick what to do with the tab; eg. create a new file, open files, new file from template, recent file, etc.
            * **New & Improved File Icons:** The language icons have been updated to be more distinctive and less generic looking.
            * **Commando has gotten a visual overhaul:** More lightweight, no borders or gradients. Commando now feels as lightweight as it is.
            * **Tons and tons of UX improvements:** An ongoing effort to make Komodo the most user friendly IDE out there by many miles.
